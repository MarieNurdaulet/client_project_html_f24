            <h2>Money</h2>
            <p>Did you know that when you donate money, your dollar goes ten times further to help a student in need?
                That’s because we use monetary donations to purchase discounted food from a community food bank.
                Any amount can make a difference in a student’s life. Please note that all monetary donations must be
                made online.</p>
            <div>
                <p>There are four options for giving. Choose your own donation path to make an impact on-campus for UM
                    community members in need.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fresh produce should be whole, with no signs of mold, spoilage or severe bruising.</li>

                    intact label with ingredients and allergens, and be in good condition (no dents,
                    bulging, or rust).</li>
                <li>We are unable to accept expired items.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Fruits & vegetables in a variety of colors. Look for canned fruit in its own juice
                    or with “no sugar added.” Look for canned vegetables what say “low sodium” or
                    “no salt added.”</li>
                <li>Whole grains as often as you can, including brown rice or barley, oatmeal,
                    quinoa and more. Look for 100% whole grain on the package or look for whole grain
                    as the first ingredient on the ingredient list.</li>
